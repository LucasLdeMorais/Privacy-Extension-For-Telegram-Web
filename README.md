The Privacy Extension For Telegram™ Web hides your messages from unwanted glimpses until you hover over them. In the search bar, you can disable the blur effect on all messages manually and specify what elements to blur.

**Your options:**
- All messages in chat: *Blurs all messages in the current chat.*
- Last messages preview: *Blurs all message previews on the left.*
- Media preview: *Blurs all images, videos, ... in separation from the text.*
- Media gallery: *Blurs all small icons of images, videos, ... while viewing an image, video, ...*
- Text input: *Makes the color in your input field lighter to make it hard to read.*
- Profile pictures: *Blurs all profile pictures.*
- Group/Users names: *Blurs all group and usernames.*
- No transition delay: *Allows you to turn off the delay before revealing an item on hover.*
